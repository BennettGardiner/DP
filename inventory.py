# A company knows that the demand for its product during each of the next four
# months will be as follows:

# Months 1 2 3 4
# Demand 2 3 2 4

# At the beginning of each month, the company must determine how many units
# should be produced during the current month. During a month in which units are
# produced, a setup cost of $3 is incurred. In addition, there is a variable cost of $1
# for every unit produced. At the end of each month, a holding cost of 50 cents per
# unit on hand is incurred. Capacity limitations allow a maximum of 5 units to be
# produced during each month. The size of the companyâ€™s warehouse restricts the
# ending inventory of each month to at most 4 units.

# How many units should the company produce each month to satisfy demand and
# minimise total cost?
